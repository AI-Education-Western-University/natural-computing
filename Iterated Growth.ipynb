        "Nature is filled with complex shapes, like the patterns on a leaf or the structure of a snowflake. But interestingly, these complex patterns are often created from simple rules. We can explore this idea using something called cellular automata. Think of cellular automata like very basic computer programs. Yet, despite being basic, they can produce surprisingly complex results! This shows us that simple rules can create intricate patterns that are hard to predict in advance. This concept is a big part of why nature is so complex and varied.\n",

        "\n",
        "For starters, imagine a row of cells, like squares in a line, where each cell is either blue or orange. The colour of each cell can change based on a rule that looks at the colours of the cells next to it (its neighbours). By stacking rows of these cells below each other, we can make a picture that shows how the colours change over time. Let's consider three simple but different rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A cell is colored <font color=\"f89c20\">orange</font> if it is *already* <font color=\"f89c20\">orange</font> or if *at least one* of its neighbors is <font color=\"f89c20\">orange</font>; otherwise, it is colored <font color=\"5790fc\">blue</font>.\n",
        "2. A cell is colored <font color=\"f89c20\">orange</font> if *at least one* of its neighbors is <font color=\"f89c20\">orange</font>; otherwise, it is colored <font color=\"5790fc\">blue</font>.\n",
        "3. A cell is colored <font color=\"f89c20\">orange</font> if *exactly one* of its neighbors is <font color=\"f89c20\">orange</font>; otherwise, it is colored <font color=\"5790fc\">blue</font>.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to turn each of these rules into a Python function. Each function has two arguments: the entire row of the cells and then the index of the cell that we want to colour. Let's break down what those two arguments will look like. First, we'll use a list (called an array) to represent the line of cells. You can think of an array as an ordered list of values. Second, we pass the function the index of the cell to which we want to apply the rule. Each item in the array has an index: its position in the list. In most programming languages, including Python, array indices start at 0. So, the first item in the array would be at index 0, and the second element would be at index 1, and so on. When we draw our array, we'll start from left to right. For our array, we'll put a `0` to represent a blue cell and a `1` to represent an orange cell. By default, we'll start our array as all blue cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we want to get the first element of an array called `array`, we write (in Python): `array[0]`. We can also let the index be a variable. So, to get the cell at position `n` in our list, we write `array[n]`. We can also perform mathematical operations on the index within those square brackets. Recall that the 0-index element is the leftmost element. So, what would be the index of the element directly to the left of the element with index `n`? `n - 1`! And the index of the right neighbour would be `n + 1`. But what if the element doesn't have a left neighbour? Would the left neighbour for `array[0]` be `array[-1]`? Python is interesting because arrays loop around, so `array[-1]` would be the rightmost element. But not all programming languages would allow that. But, to keep things simple, we'll assume that the cells on the ends of the list only have one neighbour. We'll need to account for this in our code!\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, let's discuss what our functions will return. We want to use these functions to modify the colour of the cells in our array. Therefore, returning the new colour for the cell we pass to the function makes sense! If we want to colour the cell blue, we return `0`. If we want to colour the cell orange, we return `1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before that, let's write three helper functions that will be useful to us when we go to make our rules:\n",
        "1. `get_left_neighbor`: This function tells us the cell index to the left of a given cell. If we're looking at the first cell in the list (which has an index of `0`), there's no cell to the left, so the function returns `None`.\n",
        "2. `get_right_neighbor`: This function tells us the cell index to the right of a given cell. If we're looking at the last cell in the list, there's no cell to the right. If we're looking at the last cell in the list (which has an index of `len(array) - 1`, where `len(array)` is the total number of cells), there's no cell to the right, so the function returns `None`.\n",
        "3. `get_cell_color`: This function tells us the colour of a cell at a given index in the list. It returns the cell's colour, which is the value stored at that index in the array. If the index is `None`, the function returns `-1`, which we can understand as an \"invalid colour\"."

We want to keep track of what the rows look like at each iteration step of the simulation and then stack up all the rows at the end to form an image. As such, using a 2D array is a natural solution. So instead of just a row of cells represented as a 1D array, we now have a whole grid of cells as before. This grid's width will equal the number of cells in each row. The height of this grid will be the number of iterations we will simulate.\n",

Since we will use this grid to make an image, let's call our 2D array `image`. The top row of our 2D array grid can be accessed using `image[0]`. The next row would be `image[1]` and so on. What if we wanted the first column? This one is a bit tricky; you would get the leftmost column using `image[:, 0]`. In the square brackets, two values are separated by a comma. The item on the left of the comma represents the row, and the item on the right represents the column. The `0` is straightforward; you want the column at index 0. The colon is a bit of syntax that means that you want everything. So, a colon left of the comma means you want all the rows. Combining all the rows with just column 0 means you get column 0. The next column would be `image[:, 1]` and so on. This also lets us get at an individual cell as well. If I wanted the top-left corner cell, I would use `image[0, 0]`. Its right neighbour would be `image[0, 1]`: row 0, column 1. Its bottom neighbour would be `image[1, 0]`: row 1, column 0. We will use this tool in our simulation!\n",

        "The visualization shows that the ant's path seems random for the first few thousand steps and creates a messy mix of white and black nodes on the grid. But after about 10,000 steps, the ant starts behaving differently. It moves back and forth but also drifts diagonally across the grid, creating a neat, repeating pattern of white and black nodes. This pattern looks like a road or \"highway\" and is surprisingly orderly, given the ant's simple rules. This \"highway building\" always happens along 45-degree diagonals and would go on forever if the grid was infinitely big.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we run simulations like this one, we usually do it on a grid that loops around, like a video game world where you walk off one edge and return on the other. So, when the ant keeps going, it eventually leaves the grid at the bottom-right corner and pops back in at the top-left corner, still moving in the same direction. When it does this, it'll run into the path it just made, which makes the ant go kind of crazy. For a while, it paints the grid randomly, as it did in the first 10,000 steps. But, after many steps, it starts making a highway again, but now it's going in a different direction, to the bottom-left. Over time, as the grid gets filled with random patches and highways crossing each other, it gets harder and harder for the ant to keep building highways. The whole grid will eventually look random if the simulation runs long enough."

The important takeaway is that simple rules can lead to seemingly complicated results. But does that make those results truly \"complex\"? Or do we call them \"complex\" just because they look intricate? This is a question that people studying complexity have been pondering for a long time.\n",

It seems logical that more complex patterns would need longer programs. However, our study of 1D cellular automata showed this is only sometimes true. The four different cellular automata we looked at can be made with programs of the same length, but they aren't equally complex.\n",

        "In studying cellular automata, we also encountered a common characteristic of complex systems: *emergence*. This term is used when a system has features or behaviours that can't be predicted just by looking at its parts. These new features or behaviours *emerge* from how the parts interact. The snowflakes and ant highways we saw are examples of this."
